            <p>I am an Electrical Telecommunications Engineering who 
                enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from <br> different 
                disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from 
                various industries. I have strong technical <br> skills and an academic 
                background in engineering, statistics, web development, and Object-Oriented Programming.
            </p>

                My passion lies in solving business problems and 
                communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders.

                solutions.
