            <p>I am an Electrical Telecommunications Engineering who 
                enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from <br> different 
                disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from 
                various industries. I have strong technical <br> skills and an academic 
                background in engineering, statistics, web development, and Object-Oriented Programming.

                My passion lies in solving business problems and 
                communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders.

                solutions.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In my graduate studies, I've taken on various leadership roles, including mentoring 
                three undergraduate interns, <br>coordinating institute-wide events for hundreds of people, and leading clubs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm graduating in November 2021, and I'm interested in part-time Electrical or Telecommunications roles.
