            <h1>Atandi.</h1>
            <p>I am an Electrical Telecommunications Engineering who 
                enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from <br> different 
                disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from 
                various industries. I have strong technical <br> skills and an academic 
                background in engineering, statistics, web development, and Object-Oriented Programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion lies in solving business problems and 
                communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. 
                <br> I can jump across verticals to deliver high-level technically written
                solutions.

                    food in pounds that each animal needs to be fed. <br> 
                    The project is written in a pseudocode language that gives logical description <br>
