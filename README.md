# Jared Atandi *landing page* #

The programming portfolio is a personal *CV* landing page that will showcase
all the projects that I have undertaken in regard to programming. 

Besides it being my *CV* site, it will also double up as my part of Independent Project (IP)
at Moringa School. 

The site uses **MIT open source** licensing. 

<!-- TODO: fix the live link-->
It will be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaredatandi/Programming_Portifolio.git)
